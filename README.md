This is the code repository for [Learning Robotics Using Python](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/learning-robotics-using-python?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781783287536), published by Packt.

**Bring robotics projects to life with Python! Discover how to harness everything from Blender to ROS and OpenCV with one of our most popular robotics books.**

## What is this book about?
Learning about robotics will become an increasingly essential skill as it becomes a ubiquitous part of life. Even though robotics is a complex subject, several other tools along with Python can help you design a project to create an easy-to-use interface.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Understand the core concepts and terminologies of robotics 
* Create 2D and 3D drawings of robots using freeware such as LibreCAD and Blender 
* Simulate your robot using ROS and Gazebo 
* Build robot hardware from the requirements 
* Explore a diverse range of actuators and its interfacing

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
<xacro:include filename=”$(find
chefbot_description)/urdf/chefbot_gazebo.urdf.xacro”/>
<xacro:include filename=”$(find
chefbot_description)/urdf/chefbot_properties.urdf.xacro”/>
```

## Get to Know the Author
**Lentin Joseph**
is an electronics engineer, robotics enthusiast, machine vision expert, embedded programmer, and the founder and CEO of Qbotics Labs (http://www.qboticslabs.com) in India. He got his bachelor's degree in electronics and communication engineering at the Federal Institute of Science and Technology (FISAT), Kerala. In his fi nal year engineering project, he created a social robot, which can interact with people. The project was a huge success and got mentioned in visual and print media. The main feature of this robot was that it could communicate with people and reply intelligently. It also has some image-processing capabilities, such as face, motion, and color detection. The entire project was implemented using the Python programming language. His interest in robotics, image processing, and Python began this project.

After graduation, he worked at a start-up company based on robotics and image processing for 3 years. In the meantime, he learned famous robotic software platforms—such as Robot Operating system (ROS), V-REP, and Actin (a robotic simulation tool)—and image processing libraries, such as OpenCV, OpenNI, and PCL. He also knows about robot 3D designing, embedded programming on Arduino, and Stellaris Launchpad.

After 3 years of work experience, he started a new company called Qbotics Labs, which is mainly focused on research to build great products in domains such as wearable technology, robotics, machine vision, green technology, and online education. He maintains a personal website (http://www.lentinjoseph.com) and a technology blog called technolabsz (http://www.technolabsz.com). He publishes his works on his tech blog. He was a speaker at PyCon2013 India, and he spoke on the topic of learning robotics using Python.
